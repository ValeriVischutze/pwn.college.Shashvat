# Intro to Arguments
The aim of the challenge is to invoke a command followed up by an argument or parameter.

## My solve:
**Flag:** `pwn.college{8PYDvSvtCD7NNTfj6AryyTYPC0m.QX4YjM1wiN3AzNzEzW} `
Arguments or parameters are essentially the additional info passed onto the command. For instance the command `cat wow.txt` would result in the terminal printing out the contents of the file `wow.txt` as our output.
Likewise for an `echo I got the cards` command would result in the terminal printing `I got the cards` as our output.
In the first command `wow.txt` was the argument and in the second command, `I`,`got`,`the` and `cards` were the argument.
Upon invoking the command `hello hackers`, the flag was obtained.

## What I learned:
An argument essentially directs the flow of the command issued by giving it an additional info or path.
