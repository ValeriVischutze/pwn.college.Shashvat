# Intro to Commands
The aim of the challenge is to invoke the very first command

## My solve:
**Flag:** `pwn.college{sbunGhbWKIta0eLrev0oJqErAvG.QX3YjM1wiN3AzNzEzW}`

In the shell or the command line, the user has to invoke a command which is (not necessarily) followed by an argument or a parameter. For instance issuing the command `echo what's up fellas?` will result in `what's up fellas?` being printed out as our output.
In this given prompt, `echo` is the command given and `What's up everyone` is our argument or parameter.
There are several other commands such as `cat` which outputs a file or `whoami` which prints hacker as the output, as the user is by default referred to.
Upon invoking the `hello` command, the flag was obtained.

## What I learned:
A basic understanding of how to invoke a command, with and without an argument.
