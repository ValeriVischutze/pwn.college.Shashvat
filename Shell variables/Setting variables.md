# Setting variables
The aim of this challenge is to set up the PWN variable and assign it the value COLLEGE.

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{oYv3cSlbiV6be1IFgDbY3kZIMCC.QX5UTN0wiN3AzNzEzW}`

```
PWN=COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{oYv3cSlbiV6be1IFgDbY3kZIMCC.QX5UTN0wiN3AzNzEzW}
```
In this problem, we set the value of the variable PWN to COLLEGE, which helped us invoke the flag.
