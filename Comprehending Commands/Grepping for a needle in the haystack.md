# Grepping for a needle in the haystack
The aim of the challenge is to familiarize with the `grep` command.

## My solve:
**Flag:** `pwn.college{UfyKIydmFu33YiqKPLD67ypagvs.QX3EDO0wiN3AzNzEzW} `

The `grep` command enables us to essentially 'highlight' some content in a given target file. 
For instance we want to find out the words containing the keyword 'pwn.college' in a given text file in a directory, let's call it `word.txt` for convenience. Issuing a `grep "pwn.college" /challenge/word.txt` would result in bash printing out all texts containing the term `pwn.college`.
Likewise for the challenge here, we issue the command `grep "pwn.college" /challenge/data.txt` , as all flags contain the term 'pwn.college', to obtain our flag.


## What I learned:
Familiarization to the `grep` command and its significance as a highlighting tool in text files.
