# Moving files
To learn how to move the contents of one file to another (in the same directory).

## My solve:
**Flag:** `pwn.college{YiP85IoNlEOT-bKlKLDrkJkI3MH.0VOxEzNxwiN3AzNzEzW}`

To move the contents of one file to another, we use the `mv` command. In this case we invoked the `mv /flag  /tmp/hack-the-planet `, to move the contents of the file `/flag` to the given target file.
We then run a verification command `/challenge/check` to ensure a successful execution and hence obtain the flag.

## What I learned:
How to move the contents of one file to another, with the general syntax being `mv /initial_file /target_file`
