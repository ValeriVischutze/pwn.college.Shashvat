# Touching files
The aim of the challenge is to learn how to create new files in a given directory

## My solve:
**Flag:** `pwn.college{o-WSuJe4gikChq2-8IPA7p-Y-3r.QXwMDO0wiN3AzNzEzW}`

The `touch` command is used to create new files in a directory. In this challenge,we changed directory to `/tmp` using `cd /tmp` before proceeding to use `touch pwn` and `touch college` to create the two new files.
We can check if these files were created, by invoking the listing `ls` command.


## What I learned:
How to use the `touch` command to create new files.
