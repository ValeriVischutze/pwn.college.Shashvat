# Listing files
The aim of the challenge is to familiarize ourselves with the `ls` or list command.

## My solve:
**Flag:** `pwn.college{ovldLikjK1zA6P2wb-CZ-gY2LLW.QX4IDO0wiN3AzNzEzW} `

`ls` or list command is used to lay out or list out the contents of a given directory. We can invoke it, both through an absolute path and by positioning in a directory and simply using it without any argument or with argument if we want to list out the subdirectories.
In this challenge, we searched the challenge directory using `ls /challenge`, before invoking the `/challenge/25861-renamed-run-21976 `to obtain the flag.

## What I learned:
Function and application of the listing function through both absolute and relative paths.
