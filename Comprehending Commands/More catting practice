# More catting practice
The aim of this challenge is to obtain the flag by using a `cat` command (through an absolute path) in a given target directory.

## My solve:
**Flag:** `pwn.college{AiCWalx1BFSj1aG6JOUpayAdp7O.QXwITO0wiN3AzNzEzW}`

As again, we used the `cat` command to obtain the flag through an absolute path. The challenge also restricted us from using the `cd` command to position ourselves into the given target directory and then use the `cat` command.
We used the command `cat /usr/share/sgml/flag` to obtain the flag.

## What I learned:
Obtaining the flag through an absolute path without having to move to a different directory.
