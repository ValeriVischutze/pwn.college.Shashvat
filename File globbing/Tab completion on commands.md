# Tab completion on commands
This level has a command that starts with pwncollege, and it'll give you the flag. Type pwncollege and hit the tab key to auto-complete it!

## My solve
**Flag:** `NOT DISPLAYING`

In this challenge we pressed tab to complete pwncollege command as pwncol' then it expands the command as pwncollege-21423 entered that and got the flag.
```
pwncol<TAB>
pwncollege-21423
Correct! Here is your flag:
<NOT DISPLAYING FLAG>  (I recently changed my laptop and for some reason it's not working here)
```

## What I learned
that tab can be used with commands.
