# Matching with ?
Starting from your home directory, change your directory to /challenge, but use the ? character instead of c and l in the argument to cd! Once you're there, run /challenge/run for the flag!

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{Ivte8W9z7wED1-8XwG0opdHNHoH.QXyIDO0wiN3AzNzEzW}`

```
cd /?ha??enge
/challenge/run
You ran me with the working directory of /challenge! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{Ivte8W9z7wED1-8XwG0opdHNHoH.QXyIDO0wiN3AzNzEzW} 
```

## What I learned
Glob ? it replaces single character of an argument.
